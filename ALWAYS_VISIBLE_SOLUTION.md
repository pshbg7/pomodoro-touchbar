# Making Pomodoro Timer Always Accessible

Unfortunately, **macOS does not allow third-party apps to add buttons to the system control strip** (where volume/brightness are). This is a system security restriction.

However, here are the **best solutions** to make Pomodoro Timer instantly accessible:

## ✅ Solution 1: Global Keyboard Shortcut (BEST OPTION)

**Press ⌘+Shift+P from anywhere** - This is the fastest way!

- Works from any app
- Instantly activates Pomodoro Timer
- Shows Touch Bar with all controls
- Toggles the timer automatically

**No clicking, no menu bar, just press the keys!**

## ✅ Solution 2: Menu Bar Icon (Always Visible)

The timer icon (⏱️) is **always visible** in your menu bar:
- **Left-click** → Activates app and shows Touch Bar
- **Right-click** → Quick menu

## ✅ Solution 3: Keep App Active

1. Open Pomodoro Timer
2. Don't close the window (or minimize it)
3. The Touch Bar will show Pomodoro controls when the app is active
4. Switch between apps - when you come back to Pomodoro Timer, Touch Bar appears

## ❌ Why Control Strip Doesn't Work

The "Customize Control Strip" option in System Preferences only shows **system-level items** like:
- Volume
- Brightness  
- Siri
- etc.

Third-party apps cannot add items there for security reasons. Apple restricts this to system apps only.

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

**Use the global shortcut (⌘+Shift+P):**
1. Working in any app
2. Press ⌘+Shift+P
3. Pomodoro Timer activates instantly
4. Touch Bar shows all controls
5. Press Start/Pause on Touch Bar
6. Continue working - timer runs in background

This is actually **faster** than having a button in the control strip because:
- No need to look at Touch Bar
- Works from anywhere
- One keypress vs. finding and tapping a button

## Setup Instructions

1. **Launch Pomodoro Timer** (it starts automatically at login)
2. **Grant Accessibility Permission** (if prompted):
   - System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Accessibility
   - Enable "Pomodoro Timer"
3. **Use ⌘+Shift+P** from anywhere to access the timer!

The global shortcut is the most reliable and fastest way to access your Pomodoro timer from anywhere!
