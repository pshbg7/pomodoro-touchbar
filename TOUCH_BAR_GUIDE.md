# How to Access Pomodoro Timer in Your Touch Bar

## Quick Answer

The Pomodoro Timer Touch Bar controls appear when the **Pomodoro Timer app is active/focused**. Here's how to access them:

## Method 1: Click the Menu Bar Icon (Easiest)

1. **Look for the timer icon** (⏱️) in your menu bar (top right of your screen)
2. **Click it once** - This will activate the app and show the main window
3. **The Touch Bar will now show** the Pomodoro Timer controls:
   - Timer display (e.g., "25:00")
   - Start/Pause button (green/orange)
   - Skip button (blue)
   - Reset button (red)

## Method 2: Click the App Window

1. If the Pomodoro Timer window is open, **click anywhere on the window**
2. This makes the app active, and the Touch Bar will show the controls

## Method 3: Use Spotlight to Activate

1. Press **⌘ + Space** to open Spotlight
2. Type "Pomodoro Timer"
3. Press Enter to open/activate the app
4. Touch Bar controls will appear

## Where Do the Controls Appear?

The Touch Bar controls appear in the **main Touch Bar area** (the center section), not in the system control strip (where volume/brightness are). They will show:

```
[Timer: 25:00]  [Start]  [Skip]  [Reset]
```

## Making It More Accessible

### Option 1: Keep the App Window Open (Minimized)

1. Open the Pomodoro Timer app
2. Click the yellow minimize button (or press ⌘ + M)
3. The app stays active in the background
4. Click the app icon in the Dock to bring it forward and see Touch Bar controls

### Option 2: Customize Your Touch Bar

1. Go to **System Preferences → Keyboard → Touch Bar shows**
2. Choose **"App Controls"** or **"F1, F2, etc. Keys"**
3. This makes app-specific controls more prominent

### Option 3: Use the Menu Bar Icon

- The menu bar icon is always visible
- **Left-click** to show the window and activate Touch Bar
- **Right-click** for quick menu options

## Important Notes

⚠️ **macOS Touch Bar Behavior:**
- The Touch Bar shows controls for the **currently active app**
- When you switch to another app (like Safari, Mail, etc.), that app's Touch Bar controls will show instead
- To see Pomodoro Timer controls again, just activate the Pomodoro Timer app

✅ **Best Practice:**
- Keep the app running in the background (it launches automatically at startup)
- When you want to use the timer, click the menu bar icon
- The Touch Bar controls will appear immediately
- You can then start/pause/control the timer from the Touch Bar

## Troubleshooting

**Touch Bar not showing Pomodoro controls?**
1. Make sure the app is running (check menu bar for timer icon)
2. Click the menu bar icon to activate the app
3. The Touch Bar should update within a second

**Controls disappeared?**
- You probably switched to another app
- Just click the Pomodoro Timer menu bar icon again to reactivate

**Want controls always visible?**
- Unfortunately, macOS doesn't allow third-party apps to permanently add controls to the system control strip (where volume/brightness are)
- The controls appear when the app is active, which is the standard macOS behavior
- The menu bar icon provides quick access whenever you need it

## Quick Start Workflow

1. **On startup:** App launches automatically (if enabled)
2. **To start a timer:** Click menu bar icon → Touch Bar appears → Press "Start" on Touch Bar
3. **To check timer:** Click menu bar icon → See timer on Touch Bar
4. **To control timer:** Use Touch Bar buttons (Start/Pause/Skip/Reset)

The app is designed to be lightweight and accessible - just one click away via the menu bar icon!
